        "descriptionFromReview": "I've been in Las Palmas for two months (November and December). The climate was amazing, I could swim at Canteras Beach nearly every day. Yes, and there is a big digital nomad scene or community. On the other hand, residents are (at least in my opinion) not too friendly. As I speak Spanish very fluently (I personally come from Germany), I could figure out that many local people are jealous about our income (because most of us work in the IT and have a top income compared to Spanish employees) and about the fact that we can afford higher rents - consequently, we contribute to the increase of prices. At the beach, I could even follow a conversation between locals such as \"now due to the energy crisis, German people invade our island in order to save the high energy costs\". Besides, I didn't like the Canarian food too much, because in my opinion, it's too repetitive: grilled fish, grilled meat, potatoes with Mojo sauce - I was missing the skills and the finesse of the kitchen as you can find for example in France or in Italy. One outstanding point to emphasize: the Internet connection is brilliant, I had a 200 MB speed without any disruption.",

        "descriptionFromReview": "Stayed in Ericeira for 4 months at the end of 2022 -  Pros - - The town is beautiful and still retains a lot of charm of a little seaside town despite how popular it has become.  - The locals are so friendly and, in the event you do not speak Portuguese, will happily speak English to a great standard. - Multiple lovely, clean beaches   Cons - - Rent is crazy expensive as are many of the restaurants in the town.  - Once the peak season of summer passes, the place becomes really quiet. Not ideal for a solo traveller as I was.  Overall, I really loved Ericeira but I definitely made a mistake going there solo during autumn/winter! Can see it being a great spot to live for couples/families provided you can afford it.  ",

City is relatively safe but you'll occasionally get harassed by beggars which can create a feeling of unease. Food is very meh, the best restaurants are the turkish/greek over the traditional \"serbian\" ones. Locals are generally nice and welcoming even if you're from the US, but the youth are obnoxious and loud especially at night. The smoking especially in indoor buildings is rude and obnoxious to most but not in Serbian culture.  Overall I would say 5/10. ",

Food is difficult to find Restaurants what you can eat well.   Pros: Weather always perfect even in winter  It's an Island, so there are many beaches  2 Airports with many flights all over Europe   Fresh Fruits and Vegetable as many things grow here.  Cons: If you are a foodie its difficult to find any good food what is not Spanish or Italian  Even the Bus System is really good they need to improve with walkways or bike roads, but this is a problem in all over Spain.  Order online is a gamble sometimes is fast but as the Canary Islands are outside the European customs union you have to declare goods what the value us over 15o EUR ",

But the food is amazing, cost of living is cheap, and the parks and mountains surrounding you make it worth visiting! You can literally hike a gorgeous mountain walking about 5 minutes south of the old city center. It's also the most central location to visit nearby castles and national parks. You can buy tickets online and the trains are easy to navigate to get to places like Peles Castle in an hour or so. Highly recommend staying here a couple weeks! I hope to return.",

Architecture is interesting (but nothing to write home about) in a small touristic area, outside of it it's mostly ugly Soviet-era apartment blocks and ramshackle small houses. A couple of years ago the city was cheap, but now it's more expensive than many European cities and Asian capitals. When it was cheap, it was nice to stay there despite its drawbacks. Now it is very questionable. Drawbacks: - locals are somewhat unfriendly, nationalistic to quite high degree - they can either love you or hate you for nothing, and it happens in seconds - they drive like hell - food is the same in most places (though tasty) - low quality of everything: service, accomodations, goods etc. I'd say asian quality at european prices. I also didn't find the nature around Tbilisi particularly exciting. There is some beautiful nature in the country but it's far away from the capital.",

Bulgaria has 4 seasons summer being very hot and winter snowing and going to ski resorts, it has one of the tastiest cuisines worldwide rich in history and in culture. Also has the most beautiful women there !! It's very cheap and affordable coming from abroad. Definitely, a place to visit at least once in a lifetime. Of course, there is downside like the economy, poverty, and corruption beggars however if you choose the best places in Bulgaria you won't regret it x–æ—Ö–æ Gabriela  (–æ–±–∏—á–∞–º –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏—è)",

        "descriptionFromReview": "Taxis in Istanbul are a big problem even for locals. Public transport is convenient and comfortable. If you need to call a taxi, I recommend using an app. \"Bitaksi\" can be used. Agree with the taxi driver using google translate and negotiate in advance if necessary. Always make public transportation your first choice.  There are millions of refugees in this city against a registered population of 15 million. A significant number of asylum seekers do not have any registered documents and this creates various problems, so beware.  Nightlife is not recommended in Taksim. It is recommended that you prefer places such as Kadƒ±k√∂y or Be≈üikta≈ü, Sarƒ±yer.  Some of the foreign women I met said that they felt very safe in this city. This surprised me because I don't think so. But local young women are very sensitive and can always help you. If you are a friendly person, you will not have a hard time making friends.  As a negative feature, I can say that house rents are high.  You should prefer places that are more familiar to tourists. I can recomend Kadƒ±k√∂y.  A substantial portion of university students have English.  You can have great food and wander around one of the oldest cities in history. There are great cafes in √úsk√ºdar, Bakƒ±rk√∂y, Kadƒ±k√∂y and Balat. Especially Balat is a nice place.",
