Overall - decent place if you can overlook the rude people and the racism. ",

        "descriptionFromReview": "I really enjoyed my first week here, but as I got to know more locals and heard their stories, I was disturbed at the security situation. Almost everyone I met has horror stories about being robbed at gunpoint, robbed by the police, and in one case even drugged and robbed by a taxi driver. It's not even safe to walk a short distance at night (locals told me to just take Uber). Beyond the security issues, scams also abound, and the covid policy is wacky, with hand sanitizer being forced on you everywhere you go (watch out: many of these products from Mexico contain toxic ingredients according to the FDA). Prices are similar to in Europe, yet security is much worse. In my book, that's a bad deal. I don't see myself spending much time here in the future.",

        "descriptionFromReview": "I really enjoyed my month in Cuenca, but mostly because I wanted a chill place to focus on work and practice my Spanish. there isn't much to do, but it's very clean and safe and there's music everywhere.  beautiful churches, people are very friendly (although very little English is spoke) and it's ridiculously cheap. they use the USD as official currency and it was easy to find a huge, hearty, multi-course lunch for $2.25. no joke. there are ice cream and pastry shops every few feet it seems. the park in the center of the city (Parque Calderon) is a nice place to sit and enjoy the atmosphere. not many gringos, although there is a decent population of american retirees. there's one street (Calle Larga) which has a few bars and restaurants that cater to americans and there are some touristy places around the park, but my advice is to avoid these and wander a few blocks away from the park for good, authentic, local food. one of my favorite dishes is a seafood and onion stew called encebolloado which is fantastic and costs about $5. the Airbnb I stayed is had 100mps internet which was great. the National Park (Cajas) is beautiful. I strongly recommend a guided tour (about $75) because the trails aren't marked well and the guides are full of useful and interesting information. be prepared though, Cuenca is 2500m (8000 feet) up and Cajas is 4000m (13000 feet) up so you'll definitely feel the altitude. I stupidly went on the hike less than a week after I arrived and it was brutal. I'd wait until you have more time to acclimate to the height.",

This place is hard to navigate without a vehicle. Public transportation and uber aren't great.   I think this is an amazing place to go with someone else. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it for a long term solo traveler. The reason for that is I found the people to be a bit cold. I approached a lot of people and the interactions always felt so strange. IMO not a great place to mingle with the locals. They just seemed a bit standoffish and cold (I also have heard from other Brazilians that people from the south are cold. In comparison to Sao Paulo the people are so much more friendly and welcoming). It's much easier to mingle with the other foreigners. ",

        "descriptionFromReview": "Porto Alegre (POA) is a city brimming with beautiful Nature. Trees and birds galore. Unfortunately, there is much wasted potential where historical architecture and intelligent zoning are concerned. I've traveled throughout Brazil and lived in Sao Paulo, and I can attest that POA has the best food hands down. Customer service is top notch, and the shopping is good. Love the vintage stores and antique shops too. Sunsets on the lake are a treasure.   Gauchos are the most \"talkative\" people I've ever met in my life (and I am a world traveler who has lived in other countries). Being chatty isn't a bad thing, but the problem here is that the vast majority of people only talk about THEMSELVES. Oftentimes, non-stop. They don't ask questions about you because they have no interest. It's about showing off where they've eaten, traveled, studied, etc. Even the taxi and Uber drivers behave in this manner. Living in a city full narcissists / braggarts gets draining.  After years of being here, I've arrived at the conclusion that it's cultural (not malicious). Aside from this, they are very nice people. NOTE: In the countryside, the Gauchos tend to be polite, modest, and well-mannered. ",
